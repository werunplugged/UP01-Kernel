      If you say Y to this option, support will be included for 
      the FocalTech's capacitive or optical fingerprint sensor. 
      This driver supports almost all the TEE solutions just like 
      QSEE, Trustonic, TrustKernel, Beanpod.., also including 
      REE emulation.

      This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module 
      will be called 'focaltech_fp'.
